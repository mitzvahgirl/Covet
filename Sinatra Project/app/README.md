## Covet

Covet is my second Flatiron School project, a Sinatra CRUD Application.

Covet is a place for Broadway fans to create a personal, virtual inventory of their Broadway merchandise, memorabilia, SWAG, and the like and share with other users.

Covet allows a User to sign up, login and then manage a list of all their stuff.

To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun.

This project is open source under the MIT license, which means you have full access to the source code and can modify it to fit your own needs.
